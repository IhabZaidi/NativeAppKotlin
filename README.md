# NoteApp

NoteApp is an Android application built using native Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It is designed to clone the principles of the Talkpad app, which was originally built using Flutter. You can find the Talkpad app on the Huawei AppGallery [here](https://appgallery.huawei.com/search/talkpad?1683033599166).
